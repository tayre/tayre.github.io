            <div>
                Every array has a <em>length</em>
                property. The length property is the largest integer property of an array plus one.
                The [] postfix subscript operator converts its expression to a string, using the expression's <em>toString</em>
                method if it has one. That string will be used as the property name.
                If the string looks like a positive integer that is greater than or equal to the array's current length and is less than Math.pow(2, 32) - 1 , then the length of the array is set to the new subscript plus one.
            </div>
            <pre>
		   	
			var array = [];
			
			array[1000] = 'foo';
			
			print (array.length) //1001
			
		   </pre>
            <div>
                The <em>length </em>
                property can be set explicity. Making the length larger does not allocate more space for the array. Making the length smaller will cause all properties with a subscript that is greater than or equal to the new length to be deleted.
            </div>
            <pre>
		   	var a = [1,2,3,4,5];
			print(a); //1,2,3,4,5; 
			a.length = 2;
			print(a); //1,2;
		   </pre>
            <h2>delete</h2>
            <div>
                The <em>delete</em>
                operator can be used to remove elements from an array. This leaves a hole in the array.
            </div>
            <pre>
		   	var a = [1,2,3,4,5];
			delete a[3];
			print(a); // 1,2,3,,5
		   </pre>
            <div>
                The <em>splice</em>
                method deletes some number of elements of an array, and replaces them with others. The first argument is the index into the array.
                The second argument is the number of elements to delete. Any additional arguments get inserted into the array. If the second argument is 0, no elements are removed.
            </div>
            <pre>
			var a = [1,2,3,4];
			a.splice(2,1);
			print(a); // 1,2,4
			a.splice(2,0,3);
			print(a); //1,2,3,4
